# CammaranoMonardaPollinator2024
Repo for pollination visit surveys at four sites in Wisconsin conducted in summer 2022. The manuscript is under revisions at Natural Areas Journal:
Cammarano, J.H., S. Kroening, E.S. Calixto, and P.G. Hahn. Co-blooming neighbor plant diversity and floral display color similarity associated with higher flower visitation to focal species. Natural Areas Journal (in revision).

All the data are contained within the excel file 'Pollination_neighborhood_data21.xlsx'.
